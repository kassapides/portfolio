# Portfolio

Requirements:

- Each page should be separated out into a separate component.  In Angular a component can be a whole page or something smaller (like a navbar or footer for example).

- In order to navigate between pages you will need to use Angular's router.  Routes are basically just links between components. More info can be found in Angular's documentation: https://angular.io/guide/router

- It's important that each component looks like the screenshots. You can use whatever colors and pictures you want though. If you think something should be structurally changed please let me know first since I am your client.

- The contact form doesn't need to be functional at first. I'll help you set up the back end code to make it work "for real" when the UI work is finished.


## Mockup

The screenshots that show what you're building are in the mockup folder

Details of each screenshot:

- Home Component: This is the home page

- Portfolio List Component: This page shows all your portfolio pieces.

- Portfolio Detail Component: This is what an individual portfolio piece should look like. It could either be it's own page or a pop up modal window.

- Contact Component: This is the page with your contact form on it

- Navbar Component: This is the navbar component that will live at the top of every page

- Footer Component:  This is the footer that lives at the bottom of every page.
